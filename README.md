### Please learn a little about me here. 

__Five fun facts about me:__
* I studied Chemistry at the University of Manchester
* I lived in Japan for five years
* I can speak Japanese
* I love travelling and have been to over 20 countries
* Becoming a data engineer is my passion!

I recently completed my *CFG Kickstarter* in *Data and SQL*, it was really interesting and I was able to make a
database about my favourite characters from **Sanrio**. 

You can find more information about my favourite Sanrio character [Pompompurin](https://sanrio.fandom.com/wiki/Pompompurin).
